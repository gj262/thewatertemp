## About

_The Water Temp_ provides an alternate view of water temperature data as provided by [NOAA CO-OPS](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html?type=Physical%20Oceanography).

NOAA has a number of monitoring stations throughout the US that collect water temperature data. Typically evey 6 minutes. For a particular station this app will show the latest temperature read and the average over 24 hours. For comparison it can also show the average for the last seven days or the average for this day in prior years.

It is designed to work on small i.e. phone screens.
